Before submitting your contribution, please review the 200 rules below.
They exist to preserve consistency, maintain sanity, and confuse anyone reading this in the future.

## General Conduct

1. Be kind.
2. Be patient.
3. Be funnier than the code.
4. Remember: we're all guessing.
5. Do not make anyone cry.
6. Treat every pull request like it's production-grade, even though it isn't.
7. Avoid flame wars about semicolons.
8. Avoid flame wars about tabs vs spaces (it's spaces).
9. No existential dread in code comments.
10. If you must, make it poetic.

## Code Style

11. Always use TypeScript.
12. Never use `any`, unless you're desperate.
13. Comment everything, even the obvious.
14. Especially the obvious.
15. Variable names must have at least three characters.
16. Functions longer than 100 lines require an apology in the comments.
17. Interfaces may start with `I` if you're feeling corporate.
18. Avoid acronyms unless they're funny.
19. No function named `doThing`.
20. Functions should have both purpose and dignity.

## Commits

21. Commit messages must exist.
22. Commit messages must make sense.
23. "fix stuff" is not a valid message.
24. "I don't know why this works but it does" is acceptable.
25. Use imperative tense ("Fix bug", not "Fixed bug").
26. Explain bug fixes briefly.
27. If introducing a bug, name the commit something hopeful.
28. Keep commits under 50 lines unless it's art.
29. Commits adding cats to docs are auto-approved.
30. Commits removing cats are rejected.

## Pull Requests

31. PRs must include a short emotional summary.
32. Mention what you learned.
33. Include at least one `// TODO:` comment.
34. PR titles must be descriptive and dramatic.
    - Example: "Rewrote the storage engine to stop crying itself to sleep."
35. All PRs must pass the imaginary CI.
36. Include tests, or at least pretend to.
37. No direct pushes to `main`.
38. No force pushes unless fixing your own shame.
39. Request a review from someone, even if it's your dog.

## Documentation

40. Document every function.
41. Document every interface.
42. Keep jokes tasteful.
43. All examples must run successfully once.
44. Update the README if your change breaks it.
45. Update this file if your change breaks you.
46. Avoid passive-aggressive comments.
47. If you must, make them subtle.
48. Never delete historical comments.
49. Unless they're Naveed's.

## Testing

50. Write tests.
51. Write failing tests with dignity.
52. Write passing tests with relief.
53. Write tests that confuse future maintainers.
54. Never test in production.
55. Never test on `main`.
56. Unit tests are mandatory.
57. Integration tests are appreciated.
58. End-to-end tests are a myth.
59. Snapshot tests are tolerated.

## Style Preferences

73. Delete branches after merge.
74. Unless you forget.
75. Don't rebase unless you understand rebase.
